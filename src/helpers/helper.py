Call it the heart of the black-box. All kind of instructions are carried out by the helper functions defined herein.


helper.matrix(df_csv = None, W = None, D = None, get = None): Directs the instruction meant for the matrices. 

params:
    df_csv: object of dfhandler.dframe_csv class
    W, D: Matrices on which the operations are intended. 
    get: takes three values- 
        degree: returns degree matrix
        shifted_laplacia: returns shifted laplacian
        laplacian: returns simple laplacian
return: A matrix


helper.csv_wrapper(mat , arg = None): Directs the instruction about wrapping the matrices with enumerated rows/columns/both.

params:
    mat: the matrix which is needed to be wrapped
    arg: the way it is intended to be wrapped
return:
    wrapped matrix
